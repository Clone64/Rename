#Rename

Renames batches of files with the input of directory, pattern(extension, etc), and output name.
For example, rename(r'/home/user/Video', r'*.m4v', r'Episode%s'). Using information from the web, I wrote this to change filenames that were just numbers to "Episode#". 
To change this setting, use multiline comments ("""comment""") on everything past the if statement and uncomment the lines above it. I am mainly commiting this so I can find it later.
